title: Official plugins hexo-renderer-marked 3.0.0, hexo-migrator-wordpress 2.0.0 & hexo-migrator-rss 1.0.0 released
---

## hexo-renderer-marked 3.0.0

### Breaking change

- Remove codeblock highlight. [#134]
  - This plugin is now neutral to the code highlight library used
- Drop support of Node 8 [#155]

### Feature

- `prependRoot` option to prepend `root:` value to image path. [#111]
  - This is useful when you have custom `root:` value.
  - Example:

  ``` yml
  root: /blog/
  marked:
    prependRoot: true # disabled by default
  ```

  - When embedding an internal image, instead of using `![image-title](/blog/foo/bar.jpg)`, you can save some typing by using `![image-title](/foo/bar.jpg)` instead. When this feature is enabled, `/blog` will be automatically prepended to `/foo/bar.jpg`.
- `external_link` option to open links in new tab. [#116] [#119]
  - Usage:

  ``` yml
  external_link:
    enable: false
    exclude: []
    nofollow: false
  ```

  - `exclude: ['foo.com', 'bar.net']` skips over links that start with `foo.com` or `bar.net`, e.g. `https://foo.com/post-a/` & `https://bar.net/post-b/`. Subdomains need to be specified when applicable, including "www"; the example given here doesn't apply to `http://www.bar.com/post-c`.
  - `nofollow: true` adds `rel="noopener external nofollow noreferrer"` for [SEO](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Link_types), otherwise it's just `rel="noopener"` if `external_link:` is enabled.
- Support title attribute in image link [#122]
  - `![caption](http://bar.com/b.jpg "a-title")` -> `<img src="http://bar.com/b.jpg" alt="caption" title="a-title">`
- Ability to override the default rendering functions. Refer to the [docs](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-renderer-marked#extensibility) for instruction. [#129]
  - Example usage include adding a custom class name to a link or an image embed.

### Fix

- For safety, all links and image links are now encoded by default. [#112]
  - Example: `/foo/bÃ¡r.jpg` -> `/foo/b%C3%A1r.jpg`

### Refactor

- Utilize existing [`isExternalLink`](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-util#isexternallinkurl-sitehost-exclude) of hexo-util to simplify codebase. [#124]

### Dependency

- Upgrade marked from 0.7.0 to 1.0.0 [#128] [#144]
