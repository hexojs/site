{% youtube pfD6FCZdW4Q %}

Front-matter is a block of YAML or JSON at the beginning of the file that is used to configure settings for your writings. Front-matter is terminated by three dashes when written in YAML or three semicolons when written in JSON.

**YAML**

``` yaml
---
title: Hello World
date: 2013/7/13 20:46:25
---
```

**JSON**

``` json
"title": "Hello World",
"date": "2013/7/13 20:46:25"
;;;
```

### Settings & Their Default Values

Setting | Description | Default
--- | --- | ---
`layout` | Layout | [`config.default_layout`](/docs/configuration#Writing)
`title` | Title | Filename (posts only)
`date` | Published date | File created date
`updated` | Updated date | File updated date
`comments` | Enables comment feature for the post | true
`tags` | Tags (Not available for pages) |
`categories` | Categories (Not available for pages) |
`permalink` | Overrides the default permalink of the post. Permalink should end with `/` or `.html` | `null`
`excerpt` | Page excerpt in plain text. Use [this plugin](/docs/tag-plugins#Post-Excerpt) to format the text |
`disableNunjucks` | Disable rendering of Nunjucks tag `{{ }}`/`{% %}` and [tag plugins](/docs/tag-plugins) when enabled | false
`lang` | Set the language to override [auto-detection](/docs/internationalization#Path) | Inherited from `_config.yml`

#### Layout

The default layout is `post`, in accordance to the value of [`default_layout`](/docs/configuration#Writing) setting in `_config.yml`. When the layout is disabled (`layout: false`) in an article, it will not be processed with a theme. However, it will still be rendered by any available renderer: if an article is written in Markdown and a Markdown renderer (like the default [hexo-renderer-marked](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-renderer-marked)) is installed, it will be rendered to HTML.

[Tag plugins](/docs/tag-plugins) are always processed regardless of layout, unless disabled by the `disableNunjucks` setting or [renderer](/api/renderer#Disable-Nunjucks-tags).

#### Categories & Tags

Only posts support the use of categories and tags. Categories apply to posts in order, resulting in a hierarchy of classifications and sub-classifications. Tags are all defined on the same hierarchical level so the order in which they appear is not important.

**Example**

``` yaml
categories:
- Sports
- Baseball
tags:
- Injury
- Fight
- Shocking
```

If you want to apply multiple category hierarchies, use a list of names instead of a single name. If Hexo sees any categories defined this way on a post, it will treat each category for that post as its own independent hierarchy.

**Example**

``` yaml
categories:
- [Sports, Baseball]
- [MLB, American League, Boston Red Sox]
- [MLB, American League, New York Yankees]
- Rivalries
```
