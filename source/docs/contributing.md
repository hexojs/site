### Translating

#### Contribute translations

[![Crowdin](https://badges.crowdin.net/hexo/localized.svg)](https://crowdin.com/project/hexo)

Now we use the [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/hexo) platform for translation, where anyone can contribute translations and vote for translations without manual git operations.

#### Add a new language

1. Submit a new issue to let us know. The members with access to the [Crowdin Project](https://crowdin.com/project/hexo) add the language in settings.
1. After adding language in Crowdin, anyone can contribute translations on it.
1. Add the new language to [`source/_data/language.yml`](https://github.com/hexojs/site/blob/master/source/_data/languages.yml).
1. Copy `en.yml` in [`themes/navy/languages`](https://github.com/hexojs/site/tree/master/themes/navy/languages) and rename it to the language name (all lower case).
