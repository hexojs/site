title: Syntax Highlighting
---

Hexo has two built-in syntax highlight libraries, [highlight.js](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js) and [prismjs](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism). This tutorial shows you how to integrate Hexo's built-in syntax highlight into your template.

## How to use code block in posts

Hexo supports two ways to write code block: [Tag Plugin - Code Block](tag-plugins#Code-Block) and [Tag Plugin - Backtick Code Block](https://hexo.io/docs/tag-plugins#Backtick-Code-Block):

````markdown
{% codeblock [title] [lang:language] [url] [link text] [additional options] %}
code snippet
{% endcodeblock %}

{% code [title] [lang:language] [url] [link text] [additional options] %}
code snippet
{% endcode %}

``` [language] [title] [url] [link text] [additional options]
code snippet
```
````

The third syntax is a Markdown's fenced code block syntax and Hexo extends it to support more features. Check out [Tag Plugin Docs](tag-plugins#Code-Block) to find out options available.

> Tip: Hexo support posts written in any format, so long the corresponding renderer plugin is installed. It can be in markdown, ejs, swig, nunjucks, pug, asciidoc, etc. Regardless of the format used, those three code block syntax will always be available.

## Configuration

```yaml
# _config.yml
highlight:
  enable: true
  auto_detect: false
  line_number: true
  line_threshold: 0
  tab_replace: ''
  exclude_languages:
    - example
  wrap: true
  hljs: false
prismjs:
  enable: false
  preprocess: true
  line_number: true
  line_threshold: 0
  tab_replace: ''
```

The YAML above is Hexo's default configuration.

## Disabled

```yaml
# _config.yml
highlight:
  enable: false
prismjs:
  enable: false
```

When both `highlight.enable` and `prismjs.enable` are `false`, the output HTML of the code block is controlled by the corresponding renderer. For example, [`marked.js`](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) (used by [`hexo-renderer-marked`](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-renderer-marked), the default markdown renderer of Hexo) will add the language code to the `class` of `<code>`:

````markdown
```yaml
hello: hexo
```
````

```html
<pre>
  <code class="yaml">hello: hexo</code>
</pre>
```

When no built-in syntax highlight is enabled, you can either install third-party syntax-highlight plugin, or use a browser-side syntax hilighter (e.g. `highlight.js` and `prism.js` both support running in browser).

## Highlight.js

```yaml
# _config.yml
highlight:
  enable: true
  auto_detect: false
  line_number: true
  line_threshold: 0
  tab_replace: '  '
  exclude_languages:
    - example
  wrap: true
  hljs: false
prismjs:
  enable: false
```

`highlight.js` is enabled by default and used as server-side highlighting in Hexo; it needs to be disabled if you prefer to run `highlight.js` on browser-side.

> Server-side means, the syntax highlight is generated during `hexo generate` or `hexo server`.

### auto_detect

`auto_detect` is a `highlight.js` feature that detect language of the code block automatically.

> Tip: When you want to use "sublanguage highlight", enable `auto_detect` and don't mark language when writing code block.

{% note warn "Warning!" %}
`auto_detect` is very resource-intensive. Do not enable it unless you really need "sublanguage highlight" or prefer not to mark language when writing code block.
{% endnote %}

### line_number

`highlight.js` [does not](https://highlightjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/line-numbers.html) support line number.

Hexo adds line number by wrapping output inside `<figure>` and `<table>`:

```html
<figure class="highlight yaml">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td class="gutter">
    <pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre>
  </td>
  <td class="code">
    <pre><span class="line"><span class="attr">hello:</span><span class="string">hexo</span></span><br></pre>
  </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</figure>
```

It is not the behavior of `highlight.js` and requires custom CSS for `<figure>` and `<table>` elements; some themes have built-in support.

You might also notice that all `class` has no `hljs-` prefixed, we will revisit it [later part](#hljs).

### line_threshold (+6.1.0)

Accepts an optional threshold to only show line numbers as long as the numbers of lines of the code block exceed such threshold. Default is `0`.

### tab_replace

Replace tabs inside code block with given string. By default it is 2 spaces.


### exclude_languages (+6.1.0)

Only wrap with `<pre><code class="lang"></code></pre>` and will not render all tags(`span`, and `br`) in content if are languages matches this option.

### wrap

Hexo _wraps_ the output inside `<figure>` and `<table>` to support line number. You need to disable **both** `line_number` and `wrap` to revert to `highlight.js`'s behavior:

```html
<pre><code class="yaml">
<span class="comment"># _config.yml</span>
<span class="attr">hexo:</span> <span class="string">hexo</span>
</code></pre>
```

{% note warn "Warning!" %}
Because `line_number` feature relies on `wrap`, you can't disable `wrap` with `line_number` enabled: If you set `line_number` to `true`, `wrap` will be automatically enabled.
{% endnote %}

### hljs

When `hljs` is set to `true`, all the HTML output will have `class` prefixed with `hljs-` (regardless `wrap` is enabled or not):

```html
<pre><code class="yaml hljs">
<span class="hljs-comment"># _config.yml</span>
<span class="hljs-attr">hexo:</span> <span class="hljs-string">hexo</span>
</code></pre>
```

> Tip: When `line_number` is set to `false`, `wrap` is set to false and `hljs` is set to `true`, you can then use `highlight.js` [theme](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/tree/master/src/styles) directly in your site.

## PrismJS

```yaml
# _config.yml
highlight:
  enable: false
prismjs:
  enable: true
  preprocess: true
  line_number: true
  line_threshold: 0
  tab_replace: ''
```

Prismjs is disabled by default. You should set `highlight.enable` to `false` before enabling prismjs.

### preprocess

Hexo's built-in prismjs supports both browser-side (`preprocess` set to `false`) and server-side (`preprocess` set to `true`).

When use server-side mode (set `preprocess` to `true`), you only need to include prismjs theme (css stylesheet) in your website. When use browser-side (set `preprocess` to `false`), you have to include the javascript library as well.

Prismjs is designed to be used in browser, thus under `preprocess` mode only limited prismjs plugin is supported:

- [Line Numbers](https://prismjs.com/plugins/line-numbers/): Only `prism-line-numbers.css` is required, No need to include `prism-line-numbers.js` in your website. Hexo will generate required HTML mark up mark up for you.
- [Show Languages](https://prismjs.com/plugins/show-language/): Hexo will always have `data-language` attribute added as long as language is given for the code block.
- Any other prism plugins that don't need special HTML markup are supported as well, but you will have to include JavaScript required by those plugins.

All prism plugins are supported if `preprocess` is set to `false`. Here are a few things you should still pay attention to:

- [Line Numbers](https://prismjs.com/plugins/line-numbers/): Hexo won't generate required HTML mark up when `preprocess` is set to `false`. Requires both `prism-line-numbers.css` and `prism-line-numbers.js`.
- [Show Languages](https://prismjs.com/plugins/show-language/): Hexo will always have `data-language` attribute added as long as language is given for the code block.
- [Line Highlight](https://prismjs.com/plugins/line-highlight/): Both Hexo [Tag Plugin - Code Block](tag-plugins#Code-Block) and [Tag Plugin - Backtick Code Block](https://hexo.io/docs/tag-plugins#Backtick-Code-Block) supports Line Highlight syntax (`mark` option). When `mark` option is given, Hexo will generate the corresponding HTML markup.

### line_number

With both `preprocess` and `line_number` set to `true`, you just need to include `prism-line-numbers.css` to make line-numbering work. If you set both `preprocess` and `line_number` to false, you will need both `prism-line-numbers.css` and `prism-line-numbers.js`.

### line_threshold (+6.1.0)

Accepts an optional threshold to only show line numbers as long as the numbers of lines of the code block exceed such threshold. Default is `0`.

### tab_replace

Replace `\t` inside code block with given string. By default it is 2 spaces.
